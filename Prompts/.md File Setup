# Setting Up Your Initial .MD Files for Agentic Systems

This repository provides a framework for setting up Markdown-based files and folders to build self-improving agentic systems powered by any LLM (e.g., Claude, GPT, etc.). It uses a PARA structure (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) for organization, with Markdown for persistence and Python for orchestration.

## Quick Start
1. **Generate the Repo**: Copy the super prompt below into your chosen LLM (e.g., Claude, Grok) and run it. Replace "(insert LLM here)" with your LLM (e.g., "Claude").
2. **Output**: The LLM will generate file contents in a .zip-ready format. Save them to a folder named `(InsertLLMHere)AgentsVault/`.
3. **Setup**:
   - Install dependencies: `make install` (uses pyproject.toml).
   - Version control: Initialize Git and commit.
   - Tools: Open in Obsidian for linking/visualization; use VS Code for Python.
   - Run: `make run` to start the agent runner.
4. **Customization**: Upload skills to `skills/` using the template in `SKILLS_INDEX.md`. Update config in `src/config.py`.

## Super Prompt
[Paste the refined super prompt here when ready.]

## Best Practices
- Use Git for versioning .md files.
- Automate updates with nightly scripts.
- Scale memory with JSONL sidecars for queries.

For issues, see CONTRIBUTING.md in the generated repo.
